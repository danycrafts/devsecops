# DevSecOps Jenkins Plugin v1.0.0

## Highlights
- Packages the DevSecOps Jenkins shared library as an installable plugin for consistent distribution.
- Enables configurable security scanning stages for OWASP ZAP, Grype, Trivy, Semgrep, Snyk, and OWASP Dependency-Check.
- Provides reusable Jenkins Pipeline utilities for deep configuration merging and Docker execution helpers.
- Adds build-time quality gates with Spotless, SpotBugs, and Checkstyle.
- Introduces GitHub Actions workflows for GitHub releases and Jenkins Marketplace publication.

## Upgrade Notes
- Update any existing Jenkins pipelines to remove manual `@Library` referencesâ€”the plugin automatically exposes the shared library steps once installed.
- Ensure required command-line scanners are accessible in the Jenkins environment or override Docker images via the provided configuration options.
